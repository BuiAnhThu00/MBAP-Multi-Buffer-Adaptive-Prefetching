# MBAP-Multi-Buffer-Adaptive-Prefetching
The MBAP algorithm optimizes short-form video streaming by managing multiple playback buffers and adaptively prefetching segments. It improves user Quality of Experience (QoE) by reducing startup delay, rebuffering, and buffer waste, even under unstable network conditions and unpredictable user behavior.
